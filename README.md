## FAQs

##### Firestore is in beta at the time of creation, why not use something more stable?

This repository is more or less refactoring some janky, old PHP & MySQL code I've used for years, so why not use the hot new thing ~~everyone~~ existing Cloud Datastore users are going to gripe about migrating to?

##### Unmet peer dependencies when running `yarn`?

This is due to a longstanding design decision by the Yarn maintainers. You can find other references to this behavior [in their issues](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5347#issuecomment-376219812).
